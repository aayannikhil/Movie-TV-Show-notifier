# Movie/TV Show notifier Script

Who doesn’t love to watch Game of Thrones or black mirror, right? We all love to
binge watch the newest TV Series or latest episodes of our favourite seasons all
over the weekend or on a lazy afternoon.
However, we are so engaged in our work that we don’t have time to keep track of
all our favourite seasons and their latest episodes’ air time. This leads to the worst
nightmare a series buff can have.  
This is when Movie/TV Show notifier Script becomes life savior. It's written in python 3. All you need is to run the script, provide your email address and list of Movie/TV Shows you want to get notified.

## Getting Started

First download the whole repository into your PC. Then all you need is to run the script, provide your email address and list of Movie/TV Shows you want to get notified.

### Prerequisites

First you should have [Python 3](https://docs.python.org/3.0/) installed in your PC. If it's not installed one can easily install it through following links:

* [Installing Python 3 on Mac OS X](https://docs.python-guide.org/starting/install3/osx/)
* [Installing Python 3 on Linux](https://docs.python-guide.org/starting/install3/linux/)
* [Installing Python 3 on Windows](https://docs.python-guide.org/starting/install3/win/)


### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

requirements.txt contains all the necessary dependencies you need to run the script. To install all the dependencies at once you just need to install pip and run the following command:

```
pip3 install requirements.txt
```

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo
